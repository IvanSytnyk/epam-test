Only one step and I've already started
Only one step keeping me from a change
Whenever I'm scared, I take it regardless
Nothing can stop me on my way

Only one step, yeah, the first is the hardest
Only one step from a spark to the flame
Whenever I'm scared, I take it regardless
Nothing can stop me on my way (go)
